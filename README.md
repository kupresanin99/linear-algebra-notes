# linear-algebra-notes
Based on Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra
- These were teaching notes used for 200-level linear algebra course at Cecil College
- The examples and notes are almost entirely derivate of the MIT course and textbook by Gilbert Strang
- This is just my record in case I need to reference any concepts grown foggy over the years
